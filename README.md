# Hyperon Pattern Miner

## Description

The goal of this project is to port the classic Pattern Miner to Hyperon using MeTTa, the language of OpenCog Hyperon. Pattern Miner is used to identify not only frequent patterns but also interesting or surprising patterns in the large hypergraph space (Atomspace). This capability is crucial for inference, learning, and cognitive architectures.

For this current phase, we are directly porting from the classic implementation, following the same flow, algorithms, and structure. However, the actual implementation adheres to Hyperon concepts and leverages MeTTaâ€™s capabilities for  reasoning and pattern manipulation.
